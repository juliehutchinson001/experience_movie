## Synopsis

Down deep in Montana California, a young boy and his adopted older brother go for a walk into the woods hunting. Johnny, the younger boy, has his rifle in his hands and notices a large wolf in the distance. The wolf jumps on Keef attacking his arm while Keef is now pinned on the floor! Johnny tries to load his rifle but drops it into a hole, a deep one! Mikie, a member of the 300 clan, springs into action in aid of the wolf and begins to hit Keef with his club he stole from Eli, Mikie's younger brother. Billy just stood there and watched. The
